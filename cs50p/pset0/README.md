## [1. Indoor Voice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/psets/0/indoor/)

WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.

Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.

In a file called `indoor.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a `str` of your own as an argument to `input`.

Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).
- Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

## [2. Playback Speed](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/psets/0/playback/)

Some people have a habit of ~lecturing~ speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.

In a file called `playback.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with `...` (i.e., three periods).

Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).
- Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

## [3. Making Faces](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/psets/0/faces/)

Before there were emoji, there were [emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons), whereby text like `:)` was a happy face and text like `:(` was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!

In a file called `faces.py`, implement a function called `convert` that accepts a `str` as input and returns that same input with any `:)` converted to 🙂 and any `:(` converted 🙁. All other text should be returned unchanged.

Then, in that same file, implement a function called `main` that prompts the user for input, calls `convert` on that input, and prints the result. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a `str` of your own as an argument to `input`. Be sure to call `main` at the bottom of your file.

Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).
- Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).
- An emoji is actually just a character, so you can quote it like any `str`, a la `😐`. And you can copy and paste the emoji from this page into your own code as needed.

## [4. Einstein](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/psets/0/einstein/)

Even if you haven’t studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that `E = mc^2` wherein `E` represents energy (measured in Joules), `m` represents mass (measured in kilograms), and `c` represents the speed of light (measured approximately as 300000000 meters per second), per [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) et al. Essentially, the formula means that mass and energy are equivalent.

In a file called `einstein.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.

Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).
- Recall that `int` can convert a `str` to an `int`, per [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int).
- Recall that Python comes with several built-in functions, per [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).

## [5. Tip Calculator](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/psets/0/tip/)

In the United States, it’s customary to leave a tip for your server after dining in a restaurant, typically an amount equal to 15% or more of your meal’s cost. Not to worry, though, we’ve written a tip calculator for you, below!

```python
def main():
    dollars = dollars_to_float(input("How much was the meal? "))
    percent = percent_to_float(input("What percentage would you like to tip? "))
    tip = dollars * percent
    print(f"Leave ${tip:.2f}")


def dollars_to_float(d):
    # TODO


def percent_to_float(p):
    # TODO


main()
```

Well, we’ve written _most_ of a tip calculator for you. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to implement two functions:

- `dollars_to_float`, which should accept a `str` as input (formatted as `$##.##`, wherein each `#` is a decimal digit), remove the leading `$`, and return the amount as a `float`. For instance, given `$50.00` as input, it should return `50.0`.
- `percent_to_float`, which should accept a `str` as input (formatted as `##%`, wherein each `#` is a decimal digit), remove the trailing `%`, and return the percentage as a `float`. For instance, given `15%` as input, it should return `0.15`.

Assume that the user will input values in the expected formats.

Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).
- Recall that `float` can convert a `str` to a `float`, per [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float).
- Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).
